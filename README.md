# MCGI-ARMS-Project
An attendance program specifically made for MCGI. Discontinued before finishing. Member information has been removed for confidentiality.

The desktop client is written using Java, graphics implemented with Swing. An unsophisticated, custom-written CSV reader/writer was used as a placeholder until a
third party CSV reader/writer library could be selected, however, the project was discontinued before this could be done.

A Server program was written as well. IP addresses were hard coded in config files. Functional if server and desktop client are configured properly on the machine
to properly send and accept packets on the given IP address and port. The Client would be able to upload, download, and update user lists, attendance logs, and
church service schedules, which the Server program would maintain in its own file directory.

The project was discontinued as COVID-19 brought church gatherings to online gatherings, which required a different mode of taking attendance. (The church goers
did not meet physically, hence there is no single computer that runs the program for members to interact with, rendering the program temporarily useless. As other
projects come, it does not look like this project will be continued. Even it is, a new programming paradigm would be chosen now that new methods have been learned
by the writter, who was merely in his first year of college at the time of writing the program in this repository.)
